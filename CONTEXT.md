Milestone 1: Your Company's Public Website
Estas instrucciones están disponibles en español.

This document describes your company and the specific situation you're building this milestone for. Read it completely before writing any code. Everything you build must reflect this context.

Your company
Nexova is a human resources consulting and talent acquisition firm founded in 2011, headquartered in Valencia, Spain, with an expansion office in Miami, Florida. It operates across three business lines: executive and mid-management headhunting, customer support team outsourcing for technology companies, and corporate training in soft skills and leadership. It has approximately 120 employees and generates 8 million dollars in annual revenue. Its clients are primarily mid-sized companies in the technology, retail, and financial services sectors.

Your department and the problem you must solve
You work in the Marketing and Communications team, led by Carmen Ruiz. Nexova's corporate website was built in 2019 and hasn't had meaningful updates. It's slow, not accessible, and doesn't reflect the company's current positioning. Additionally, there's no system to capture leads: people interested in job opportunities or services must send a generic email to info@nexova.com. Carmen needs a modern website that professionally presents Nexova's services and captures information from potential candidates in a structured way.

Your stakeholder
Carmen Ruiz, Head of Marketing

Hi,

I need you to build our new corporate website. It should have a landing page that presents who we are, what we do, and why companies choose us to manage their talent. I also need a separate page with a form so professionals interested in job opportunities can register. We currently receive CVs by email with no structure and it's chaos. I want to capture: contact details, professional experience, sector of interest, English level, and availability. The site must be responsive, accessible, and SEO optimized. Use Tailwind for design and make sure the form validations work correctly.

Language scope
Multilingual support is optional but highly recommended due to Nexova's operations between Spain and Miami.
You must choose one base language for the full website and form experience.
If you implement a second language, treat it as an enhancement (do not reduce quality/completeness in the base language).
Landing page content
Your landing page must include the following sections, in this order:

Header
Logo or name "Nexova"
